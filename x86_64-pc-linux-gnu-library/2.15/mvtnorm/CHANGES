        0.9-9993 (22.10.2012)

        sigma is called `scale' matrix of {dpq}mvt, thanks to
        Richard Boys <Richard.Boys@ncl.ac.uk> for the hint

        0.9-9992 (19.01.2012)

        qmvt(..., df = 0, ...) gave NaN

        R CMD check works on x64 with GCC 4.6.2 (Debian 4.6.2-11) 

        0.9-9991 (10.06.2011)

        tvpack wasn't working on 64bit machines. The reason
        was that the wrapper SUBROUTINEs around the original
        FUNCTIONs didn't return the appropriate double precision
        for unknown reasons. Redefining TVTL and BVTL as FUNCTIONs
        fixed the problem.

        0.9-999 (26.04.2011)

	still problems in fix approx_interval (when !is.null(sigma));
        disable for the time being

        use fixed interval when sigma is specified in qmvt

        0.9-95 (18.11.2010)

        q{mvt,mvnorm} shall always return a list, not a vector
	checks for correlation matrices are less picky now

        0.9-94 (16.11.2010)

        allow for two different noncentral t distributions (via type
        argument)

        add support for one-dimensional quantiles (requested by Jerry Lewis
        <jerry.lewis@biogenidec.com>)

        when testing for symmetry of covariance matrices
        (and make R CMD CHECK monomvn happy again)

        both have been added as `authors'.

        new argument `algorithm' defaulting to `GenzBretz()' with 
        `Miwa()' being the alternative. Those two functions are now used
        to specify hyper parameters such as `abseps'.

        internal function `mvt' is no longer exported.

        make sure rmvnorm(1, sigma = matrix(0.5, 1, 1)) works
        (reported by Kurt Hornik)

	0.8-2 (10.02.2008)

	rmvnorm() now issues a warning for non-symmetric sigma and uses 
        the eigenvalue decomposition as default.

        Orion Poplawski <orion@cora.nwra.com> spotted a meaningless check in

        dimensions > 100). Thanks to Karen Conneely <conneely@umich.edu>
        for motivating the update and for checking the new version.

	rmvnorm() now can also use a Cholesky decomposition to compute
        the root of sigma (thanks to Fabian Scheipl)


	0.7-5 (15.09.2006)

        fix problem reported by valgrind

	use #!/bin/sh 

	0.7-0 (14.10.2004)

        empty (problem spotted by Peter Thomson <peter@statsresearch.co.nz>)
	Alan's fix prevents negative values to be returned.
