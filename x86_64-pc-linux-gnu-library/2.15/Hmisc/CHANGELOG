      'R/inc-dec.s' created 2 new functions 'inc<-' and 'dec<-'.  'inc<-' increments
      'x' by value assigned to it.  'dec<-' does the same thing but decrements 'x'.

      so that is it run on each row of the response instead of the
      entriorty of the response.

      latex math enviroment.
